A program that models production lines in the Shell plant. As an alternative to modelling data using excel, this project aims to do analysis and simulation using Python (and numpy/matplotlib to do the graphing). 

The main components:

1) The Entity-Builder -- used to take some of the drudgery out of data entry work. Short forms are used for product names and products with their pallettes are tightly coupled with a Line data structure. This allows for assured integrity of the data: as an example, only certain products will be produced on certain lines, or on certain pallettes. This is a clear dvantagre to excel where it's much harder to enforce such measures.

2) Production-Scheduler -- The meat of the program which allows for statistical analysis and plotting of data generated by the entity-builder

The other files in the lib directories are mainly classes to represent objects as well as loader programs to support working with different csv formats (excel and raw data formats).
